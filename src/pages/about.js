            Hello, I’m Fabian &mdash; a product designer and developer based in
            Potsdam, Germany.
          </p>
          <p>
            I’ve been working both as a product designer and frontend developer
            for over 5 years now. I particularly enjoy working with companies
            that try to meet broad and unique user needs.
          </p>

            <a className="caps" href="//www.en.fh-potsdam.de">
              FHP

            <Link to="/side-projects">Side Projects</Link> regularly.
          </p>
          <p>
            Using the power of design, I want to help make technology usable and
            accessible for everyone — hence my fondness for the web.
          </p>
          <p>
            I’m into working iteratively on projects, owning problems and
            solving them through interdisciplinary work and teams. For me it’s
            crucial to act at the intersection of design & code, sharpening my
            skills continuously in every direction.
