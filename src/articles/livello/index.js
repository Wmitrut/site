      <p>
        In February 2018, I joined a start-up called Livello for a limited time
        as a contractor. Livello produces and maintains smart fridges/vending
        machines.
      </p>
      <p>
        They are set up inside office spaces or college campuses, and allow
        painless purchasing of healthy snacks, meals and drinks.

        I was brought in to design and develop an MVP for an upcoming pitch
        presentation. Within one month, I designed and developed an interface
        for fridge management and a React Native app.
      </p>
      <p>
        I collaborated with Jose (Backend + Frontend), Pedro (Hardware +
        Firmware), Nelson (Hardware + Firmware) and the Livello team.

      <h2>Fleet Management</h2>
      <p>
        I designed and built a dashboard for Livello employees. It allows
        managing fridges and products from one central place.

        Building the web frontend was especially focused on easy extendability.
        An agnostic approach was crucial in both design and development.

      <h3>Full PWA</h3>
      <p>
        The web frontend is a full Progressive Web App experience. It achieves a
        Lighthouse score above 90 and can be used on any device.

        We developed a consumer mobile application that enables Livello
        customers make purchases right from their phone. Open the fridge, take
        what you want, and close the door. That's it!

    <Block align="right" pull>
      <p>
        Customers can set up their payment methods and get an overview of their
        transactions. Opening a fridge to start shopping is only one tap away.

      <h3>Technology</h3>
      <p>
        Luckily for us, we were able to use the same tech stack across the
        platforms and applications. React (+Native) handles the UI,
        styled-components manages styling across platforms, and MobX takes care
        of the application state.
      </p>
    </Block>

    <Block align="right">
      <h3>&nbsp;</h3>
      <p>
        Given these circumstances, we were able to come up with working
        prototypes within a very limited timeframe. Additionally, the interfaces
        work across all major platforms: Web, Android and iOS.
