        In the spring semester 2017 at FH Potsdam, I teamed up with{' '}
        <a href="http://kevinschiffer.com">Kevin</a>,{' '}
        <a href="https://instagram.com/julezvanderlinden">Isabell</a> and{' '}
        <a href="http://casparkirsch.de">Caspar</a> to work on a project during
        a class supervised by Marian Gunkel (<span className="caps">SAP</span>).
        The class focused on Lean Startups, Design Sprints and User Testing.

        We asked ourselves how we can support amateur and professional athletes
        during uncertain times of injury and recovery. Together, we came up with
        DSK Companion — a service design concept for insurance companies.

      <h3>Persona & Scenario</h3>
      <p>
        We created a persona as one of our first steps in our Google Design
        Sprint process: Max, a 23 year old amateur soccer player, who suffered a
        ligament rupture during a game. He has to undergo surgery and
        rehabilitation. We documented his journey in a user story.

      <h3>Value Proposition Canvas</h3>
      <p>
        After that, we moved on to create a Value Proposition Canvas consisting
        of “Jobs”, “Pains” and “Gains” of our persona. We then took a vote to
        see which aspects are most important to us.
      </p>
    </Block>

    <Block>
      <h3>Ideation</h3>
      <p>
        Going forward from the Value Proposition Canvas, we were able to ask
        “How might we...” questions and generate ideas/solutions for those
        questions.
      </p>
      <p>
        We took a vote again and settled on the use of a digital timeline to
        help athlethes visualize their healing progress.

      <h2>Wireframing</h2>
      <p>
        We created the initial wireframes together on a whiteboard, then moved
        on to&nbsp;Figma.

      <h3>Prototyping & User Testing</h3>
      <p>
        With the digital wireframes on our hands we were able to build a click
        dummy and hand it to potential users.
      </p>
      <p>
        We got the feedback that the timeline was a little confusing and so we
        added additional affordances to the main screen of our app and got rid
        of some elements that added unneccesary complexity.

      <h2>Screendesign</h2>
      <p>
        Once we were happy with our prototype, we worked out the screendesign of
        the DSK companion for iOS&nbsp;11.
