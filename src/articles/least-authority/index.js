        Late 2016 I was asked to design and develop a website for the{' '}
        <a href="https://zcashminers.org/">Zcash Open Source Miner Challenge</a>,
        which was operated by Least Authority. After the launch, I helped Least
        Authority redesign their own website, taking care of both development
        and design.

        Least Authority is building an affordable, ethical, usable, and lasting
        data storage solution. Their focus lies heavy on open source software,
        transparency and end-to-end cryptography. They offer a verifiably secure
        off-site backup system for individuals and businesses.

      <h3>Visual Exploration</h3>
      <p>
        As the branding already existed, I only made small tweaks to the visual
        appearance of the company. After researching about Least Authority and
        its products, I decided to go with <em>DIN Next Pro</em> as a typeface.
        A strong red was used as the accent color, together with several shades
        of grey.

      <h3>Technology</h3>
      <p>
        The website was coded on top of the static content management system{' '}
        <a href="https://www.getlektor.com/">Lektor</a>, to provide a familiar
        Python <span className="caps">API</span> for Least Authority’s
        developers. It is fully customizable through an admin panel, changes are
        pushed continuously through their GitHub repository.
